# Machine learning methods applied to genotyping data in late onset Alzheimer’s disease

Python scripts used in the article: *Machine learning methods applied to genotyping data capture interactions between single nucleotide variants in late onset Alzheimer’s disease* 

Python 3.7.6 with Scikit-learn v0.22.1 module was used to build the ML models. Scripts are divided in the different ML methods:

- GB : GradientBoostingClassifier
- RF : RandomForestClassifier
- ET : ExtraTreesClassifier

### Structure of the scripts:

- \*\_DisGeNet_CV_Over.py : Model generated using oversampling
-
